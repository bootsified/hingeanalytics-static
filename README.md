# Hinge Analytics (2016)

- Client: Hinge Analytics
- Agency: Switch
- Design: Switch
- Development: Boots

This is a static HTML version of a prototype website I built for a Hinge Analytics. It was a fun, mostly-one-pager website, featuring a chimpanzee on a laptop, because why not? The design for the site was by Switch in Dallas. I developed the website, including all the layout and interactivity.

This website is for my personal portfolio only.
